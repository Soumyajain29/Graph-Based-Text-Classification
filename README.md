For the baselines mentioned in results, please refer follwoing codes that we had implemeneted:

* TF-IDF with Logistic Regression:[TF-IDF + LR]( https://github.com/deekshakoul/Sentiment-Analysis-for-movie-reviews.git)
* LSTM with pre-trained GloVe embeddings(d=300) : [LSTM - GloVe](https://github.com/deekshakoul/Examples-of-DL-NLP-using-Pytorch.git)
* For BERT, we used a package [Simple Transformers](https://simpletransformers.ai/)
* Code for TGCN and VGCN-BERT: gcn.py + adjacency.ipynb + train.py
