# Graph-based-text-classification

This code is for our proposed model in DL-NLP course.
![See proposed model here](https://github.com/Soumyajain29/Graph-Based-Text-Classification/blob/main/model.jpg)

* Steps to run this model:
1. Datasets of MR, SST-2, R8 and 20ng should be put under Data/ and path needs to be updated in config.py file
2. For parameter tuning, use config.py file and change parameters.
3. python3 train.py

Baselines:
